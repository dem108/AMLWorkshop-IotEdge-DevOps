# Day 2: Dive into Many Models approach

- Pre-requisites for Day 2
  - Full understanding of key concepts on [ML Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines)
  - Watch videos ([1](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Docs-AI/Building-Large-Scale-Machine-Learning-Forecasting-Models-using-Azure-Machine-Learnings-Automated-ML), [2](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Docs-AI/Building-Large-Scale-Machine-Learning-Models-using-Azure-Machine-Learning), less than 30 min in total) on the solution accelerator for many models
  - Bring any questions on Pipeline before Day 2
  - (Optional) Create SSH key pairs (OpenSSH rsa format) and install [VSCode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-vs-code-remote) for remote connection
